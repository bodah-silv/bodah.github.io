## Adaptive Warehouse Navigation System
- Real-time navigation with **YOLOv8** detection and **BLIP-2** VLM reasoning across vision–language inputs.
- Synthetic scene generation via diffusion; Prompt-to-Prompt variants for obstacle density and shelf layouts.
- Heuristic grid planning with VLM-informed constraints for efficient, collision-free trajectories.

## AudioGen — Audio-Driven Music Generation (MusicGen + CLAP)
- Built an **audio→text** labeler guiding a pretrained **MusicGen** to produce longer clips matching input style.
- Evaluation with **CLAP** similarity and Fréchet Audio Distance; batch metrics on **900+** clips.
- Full pipeline: data curation, classifier training, prompt formatting, generation orchestration, quantitative analysis.
